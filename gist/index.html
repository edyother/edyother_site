<body>
  <!-- Remove this empty div

    It looks to me like this is just creating some space between the top of the
    page and your header. Rather than using empty markup, set a margin on your
    <header> or add padding to the <body> with CSS.

    <div class="row"><br /></div>
    -->

  <!-- Replace this <div> with a <header>

    <header> is a landmark section that helps users of assistive technology
    such as a screen reader identify different sections of the page.

    Changed the margin-top from -2px to 0.75rem. A rem is equivalent to the
    font size the user has set in their browser. It's generally preferable to
    use relative units like rem and em instead of px because rem and em will
    scale according to the user's preferred font size. The default font size in
    browsers is 16px, so 0.75rem si probably going to work out to be 12px.
    Between the empty div (removed above) which was 14px high, and the -2px
    margin here, you had about 12px of space before this element, so 0.75rem
    ought to recreate roughly the same layout. Generally speaking I'd try to
    avoid defining inline styles like this and add something like this to your
    CSS instead. This way it applies on all of your pages and you don't have to
    remember to keep adding the style="" attribute on all pages.

      margin-top: 0.75rem;

                ARIA is a standard that provides additional HTML attributes for
                assistive technology. aria-current signals to the assistive technology
                that this link is a link to the page the user is currently on.
                In your CSS, if you like, you can replace the .active selector
                that styles your currently active list item and instead use this
                selector:

                [aria-current="page"] {
                  /* Styles go here */

            <!-- Changed the alt text for the image

              For anyone using a screen reader, the alt text is how they
              experience the image, since they likely can't see it well if at
              all. "Banner image" tells them what the image *is* but it doesn't
              tell them what's in the image. They don't get the same experience
              as a sighted visitor who can see the picture. What constitutes
              good alt text changes depending on context and can be subjective,
              but in this case, I'd recommend describing the image literally for
              people. You don't have to keep this alt text, you can write it in
              your own voice and highlight the elements that you think are
              important.

              You may also want to add a rule like this to your CSS to prevent
              horizontal scrolling on mobile devices:

          Often users of assistive technology will use headings to get an overview
          of what's on the page and to jump to the sections of interest to them.
          Using an <h2> here will make it easier for them to find this
          information. You can still apply your welcome_text class here to
          maintain the appearance of the text, though it may require some
          adjustment to override some of the <h2> styles.

          It's also important not to skip heading levels. Since the only heading
          level we have is the <h1> for the page title, the next is an <h2>. It
          can be confusing for users of assistive technology to jump from an
          <h1> to an <h3>, for example.

            Empty alt text on this image seems like a valid choice to me, but
            you could also choose to describe the facade of Nine Irish Brothers.
            Empty alt text indicates that an image is decorative and assistive
            technology will just ignore the image (which is better than having
            no alt text, in which case the assistive technology will probably
            use the filename to announce the image). I don't think anything is
            lost by treating this image as decorative, but it could be nice to
            describe it for people anyway.

              This isn't really a heading, and as I mentioned above, skipping
              heading levels like this can be confusing. The <strong> tag is
              enough, I think, and you can add additional CSS with a class to
              style it further. Since it was no longer in a heading, I moved it
              into the <p> tag so that it is grouped with the rest of the
              information about the session.

            Instead of using the <h3> to achieve the style you want, you can
            style it with CSS by either giving it a class, or applying a style
            to all <h2> elements in a footer like this:

            footer h2 {
              /* Styles go here */

          <!-- Wrap all of your social links with an unordered list

            Lists offer some nice semantics for assistive technology; for
            example, a screen reader will announce how many items are in the
            list for people. So you're doing folks a favor by using a list here.
            The gotcha is that you're formatting your list in a horizontal row,
            and Safari will strip the list semantics when you remove the default
            list styles, so we have to use an ARIA role to add them back in for
            Safari. That's what the role="list" is doing.

            I added the social-links class so that you can easily style the list
            in your CSS with a rule something like this:

            .social-links {
              display: flex;
              flex-wrap: wrap;
              gap: 1ch;
              justify-content: center;
              list-style: none;
              padding: 0;
            }
          -->
          <ul class="social-links" role="list">
            <li>
              <!--
                Remove the title attribute from all of the anchors. It's
                unnecessary as the links will get their labels from the alt
                text on the images.
