First off, I hope this isnâ€™t overwhelming. ðŸ˜… Donâ€™t feel any obligation to make
any of these changes if you donâ€™t want to, these are just suggestions. Iâ€™ve
tried to provide explanations for each change, so hopefully you can understand
why Iâ€™m suggesting it and apply it to the rest of your site, if you so choose.
If anythingâ€™s unclear, donâ€™t hesitate to ask.

Iâ€™ve made a number of changes to fix some malformed HTML and improve the
semantics of the markup, which will help assistive technology parse your site. I
made notes of all of the changes along with some recommendations for additions
to your CSS.

Unfortunately, some of the changes I made to the markup will require some
changes to your CSS, but I didnâ€™t delve into the CSS. But if you have any
questions or trouble implementing these changes and getting your site to look
how you want, feel free to ask; Iâ€™ll do my best to help.

If youâ€™re looking for some more resources for learning HTML and CSS, web.dev has
some pretty decent materials for getting started with [Learn
HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html/) and [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/),
and the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) has a [Getting started with the
Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
guide.
